# Stocks_Statistical_Analysis

This is the final project of the Stats for Finance class taught by Prof. Hammou Elbarmi at Columbia University.  
In this repository, I chosed 15 stocks and I applied the statistical and financial methods taught in class on their monthly prices from September 2016 to November 2021.
